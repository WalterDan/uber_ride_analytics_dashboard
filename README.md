## Project Overview:
This project explores Uber ride data to uncover trends in demand, customer & driver behavior, cancellations, revenue, and service efficiency. The dataset used contains 150,000 rows × 21 columns, sourced from Kaggle.

## Aim and Objective

* Aim*
The aim of this project is to analyze Uber ride data to uncover patterns in demand, service efficiency, customer and driver behavior, and revenue performance, and to present these insights through an interactive Power BI dashboard that supports data-driven decision-making.

* Objectives*

- Data Acquisition & Preparation:
Source the Uber dataset from Kaggle (150,000 rows × 21 columns).

Clean, encode, and transform the data using Python to ensure accuracy and consistency.

- Data Validation & Querying:
Use SQL Server to query, validate, and cross-check key performance indicators (KPIs).

Ensure that the metrics align with real-world ride-hailing business logic.

- Dashboard Development

Design an interactive Power BI dashboard that highlights:

Ride volume and demand trends

Booking completion vs cancellations

Revenue by vehicle type, location, and payment method

Service efficiency (wait times, trip distances)

Customer and driver ratings.


- Insight Generation

Identify peak demand hours and hotspots for ride activity.

Examine the relationship between wait times, cancellations, and ratings.

Explore the impact of payment preferences and vehicle type distribution on revenue.

Business Value

Provide actionable insights that can help ride-hailing platforms:

Optimize driver allocation

Improve customer satisfaction

Reduce cancellations

Enhance revenue strategies
